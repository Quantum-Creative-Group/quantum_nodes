We need to understand the execution mechanism of Animation Nodes first.
Execution Mechanism
Animation Nodes looks at the node tree, generates an equivalent Python code, and finally executes that code. To do that, Animation Nodes asks every node for its execution code, that is, the list of lines that the node would like to contribute to the full code of the node tree. The way that Animation Nodes asks a node tree for its execution code is as follows. First, Animation Nodes looks at the return value of the getExecutionFunctionName method. This function is defined in the base class as follows:
   def getExecutionFunctionName(self):
        return "execute"
Meaning that if the node doesn't define this method, execute will be returned. Then, Animation Nodes look in the node for a method by that name, if a method with that name was found, this method is assumed to be the execution function of the node, and Animation Nodes contributes a single line of code that executes that method passing the inputs of the node as arguments and assigning the return value of the node to the node outputs.
For instance, lets look at the following example node definition:
   def create(self):
        self.newInput("Quantum Circuit", "Input Circuit", "input")
        self.newInput("Integer", "Qubit Index", "qubit_index")
        self.newOutput("Quantum Circuit", "Output Circuit", "output")

    def execute(self, input, qubit_index):
        input.h(qubit_index)
        return input
The node doesn't define an getExecutionFunctionName method, so the return value will be execute. Animation Nodes checks if there are any method named execute in the node, which it finds. So a single line is contributed to the full execution code of the node tree, which is as follows:
output = self.execute(input, qubit_index)
Typically, if your nodes have multiple modes of operations, you would define multiple execution methods and choose between them in the getExecutionFunctionName method. For instance:
   def create(self):
        self.newInput("Quantum Circuit", "Input Circuit", "input")
        self.newInput("Integer", "Qubit Index", "qubit_index")
        self.newOutput("Quantum Circuit", "Output Circuit", "output")

    def getExecutionFunctionName(self):
        if self.someOption:
            return "executeSomeOption"
        else:
            return "executeSomethingElse"

    def executeSomeOption(self, input, qubit_index):
        # Do something.

    def executeSomethingElse(self, input, qubit_index):
        # Do something else.
In this case, Animation Nodes will contribute either of the following two lines depending on the value of self.someOption:
output = self.executeSomeOption(input, qubit_index)
output = self.executeSomethingElse(input, qubit_index)
Okay. What about the case when the return value of getExecutionFunctionName doesn't corresponds to any method in the node? For instance, if getExecutionFunctionName is not defined (Meaning the return value will be execute) but no execute method exists in the node. In this case, Animation Nodes assumes the node defines a getExecutionCode method and that the method will take charge of contributing the execution code to the full node tree code itself. The following node definition is identical to the one above, except it uses the getExecutionCode method:
   def create(self):
        self.newInput("Quantum Circuit", "Input Circuit", "input")
        self.newInput("Integer", "Qubit Index", "qubit_index")
        self.newOutput("Quantum Circuit", "Output Circuit", "output")

    def getExecutionCode(self, required):
        yield "input.h(qubit_index)"
        yield "output = input"
The node doesn't define an execute method, so the output of the getExecutionCode method is contributed directly to the full execution code of the node tree. Notice that this method is a python generator of strings, meaning it should yield the lines of code as strings, as can be seen above. The getExecutionCode code doesn't take the inputs of the node as arguments, it only takes a single argument required as input. required is a set containing the identifiers of all outputs that are linked. That mean the expression if "output" in required: is True if and only if the output is linked to something in the node tree. required is usually used to conditionally contribute code only when certain outputs are actually used.
If getExecutionCode doesn't take the inputs as arguments, then how do we access the inputs of the node? In the method above, you can see that we accessed the inputs through some variable, but how do we know the variable names of the inputs and outputs? The answer lies in the two methods getInputSocketVariables, getOutputSocketVariables. Those methods define the mapping between the variable names in the execution code and the inputs of the node. Those methods are defined in the base class of the node as follows:
   def getInputSocketVariables(self):
        return {socket.identifier : socket.identifier for socket in self.inputs}

    def getOutputSocketVariables(self):
        return {socket.identifier : socket.identifier for socket in self.outputs}
They both return a dictionary, whose keys are the identifiers of the sockets (The identifiers are the third argument in your newInput call, or the second argument if the third is not provided) and the values of the dictionary are the variable names of the sockets. If those methods are not defined, the variable names will be the identifier names, hence why we use the identifiers as variable names above. But we can change those variables names by defining either functions:
   def create(self):
        self.newInput("Quantum Circuit", "Input Circuit", "input")
        self.newInput("Integer", "Qubit Index", "qubit_index")
        self.newOutput("Quantum Circuit", "Output Circuit", "output")

    def getInputSocketVariables(self):
        return {"input" : "inputQuantumCircuit", "qubit_index" : "quantumQubitIndex"}

    def getOutputSocketVariables(self):
        return {"output" : "outputQuantumCircuit"}

    def getExecutionCode(self, required):
        yield "inputQuantumCircuit.h(quantumQubitIndex)"
        yield "outputQuantumCircuit = inputQuantumCircuit"
This should cover the basics of how one can define node execution code.
Your Code
Your first method is:
   # Not so sure of what this does.
    def getInputSocketVariables(self):
        return {socket.identifier : "element_" + str(i) for i, socket in enumerate(self.inputs)}
Hopefully, it should be clear what this does now. It will let you reference the input data using the variable names element_0, element_1, element_2, and so on. However, notice that the first input Input Circuit is now assigned to the variable name element_0, which is probably not what you want. So we can change the method to account for this:
   # Not so sure of what this does.
    def getInputSocketVariables(self):
        socketMapping = {socket.identifier : "element_" + str(i) for i, socket in enumerate(self.inputs[1:])}
        socketMapping["input_circuit"] = "inputCircuit"
        return socketMapping

Your second method is:
   def getExecutionCode(self, required, input_circuit):
        try:
            #here I want to apply the function  input_circuit.h() at all the input indexes and then return the circuit.
            for index_input in self.inputs[1:]:  #I don't want the first input to be tanken into account since it is the input circuit 
                input_circuit.h(index_input.data)
            createOutputCircuit = self.outputs[0].getFromValuesCode().replace("value", input_circuit) #don't know if I'm using this right
            return createOutputCircuit
        except:
            return
As we said, the getExecutionCode function only takes required, so input_circuit shouldn't be in the method header. Moreover, the code need to be yielded as strings instead, so the full function should be something like:
   def getExecutionCode(self, required):
        yield "try:"
        for i in range(len(self.inputs) - 1)
            yield f"    inputCircuit.h(element_{i})"
        yield "    output_circuit = inputCircuit"
        yield "except:"
        yield "    self.raiseErrorMessage('Failed to do Quantum operation.')"
Make sure you get the indentation right when writing the strings. Also notice that the variable names are as we defined above in getInputSocketVariables.

Your next method is:
   def edit(self):  
        emptySocket = self.inputs["..."]
        origin = emptySocket.directOrigin
        if origin is None: return
        socket = self.newInputSocket()
        socket.linkWith(origin)
        emptySocket.removeLinks()
The edit method of a node is executed whenever the user connects something to the node. This node uses a special input socket type called "Node Control", this socket is the transparent one you see in the node. This socket is never connected to something, but when you try to connect something to it, a new socket is created and the connection goes to that socket instead. And that's exactly what the edit method above does. The method does the following:
It gets the Node Control socket by its identifier ...
It checks the value of directOrigin. This value contains the output socket that was connected to this input. Or None if no output was connected.
If directOrigin was None, nothing happens and the method returns.
Otherwise, a new socket is created.
The new socket is connect to the directOrigin.
The original link to the Node Control socket is removed.

Your next method is:
   def recreateSockets(self, inputAmount = 2):
        self.clearSockets()

        self.newInput("Node Control", "...")
        for i in range(inputAmount):
            self.newInputSocket()
This method is probably not needed in your case. So it can be omitted. However, you still need to create the Node Control somewhere. In this case, you can define the setup method, which is only called once when the node is added:
   def setup(self):
        self.newInput("Node Control", "...")
        self.newInputSocket()
Additionally, we also create one new socket, but you can omit that if you don't want any inputs initially.

Your next method is:
   def newInputSocket(self):
       #the user can add as many indexes as he wants 
        socket = self.newInput("Integer","Qubit Index")
        socket.dataIsModified = True
        socket.display.text = True
        socket.text = "Qubit Index"
        socket.removeable = True
        socket.moveable = True
        socket.defaultDrawType = "PREFER_PROPERTY"
        socket.moveUp()

#what does those two lines do?
        if len(self.inputs) > 3:
            socket.copyDisplaySettingsFrom(self.inputs[1]) 

        return socket
The method is called by the setup and edit methods to create a new socket and set some of its properties, some of those properties are straightforward, other are dependent on your socket type. Let me know if you want me to elaborate on one of them. Aside from the obvious, I actually have no idea what those two lines do. It is probably legacy code.
Recommendations
I think the easier approach would be to create an Integer List instead and just loop over its elements in an execute method. Or do you have a specific use case for your current approach?
