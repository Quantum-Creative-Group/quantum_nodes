# Quantum Nodes
Quantum Nodes is an extension of [Animation Nodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes) for [Blender](https://github.com/blender) built with [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit).
<br/>
This add-on offers tools to incorporate quantum computing into your creation process.

It even allows you to send your quantum circuits to real qubits provided by [IBM](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).

Get started with Quantum Nodes by reading the [documentation](https://quantum-creative-group.gitlab.io/quantum_nodes_manual/).
