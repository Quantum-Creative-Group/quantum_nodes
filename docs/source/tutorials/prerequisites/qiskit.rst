Qiskit and computers
********************

We have seen how quantum circuits work, but now in order to use them we have to know how to make quantum computers, or at least quantum computer simulators, read them. 
|   That is why IBM created Qiskit, a library that allows you to create quantum circuits and have them read by a simulator, or even send them on real quantum computers.

|   Following the processing of the quantum circuits, it is possible to get the results. 
|   In our case for example we will be able to obtain the histogram of the probabilities or the state vector of the qubits.


.. note::
    Quantum Nodes works thanks to Qiskit. Based on the Animation Nodes add-on, Quantum Nodes provides nodes that allow you to create quantum circuits, have them read by a simulator and retrieve the results.
    Now that you know more about how quantum circuits and Quantum Nodes work, it is time to create our first algorithms on Blender! |:wink:|
